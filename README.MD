# Do. Fancy and easy AI inside your editor.

An AI Content assistant without all the bells and whistles. Use your own OpenAI API key, or for free and ad supported (but very friendly) through the Do. servers.

There are two things need to know.

The tilde (backtick, or `) will revert to the previous /do command. You can easily regenerate after that by pressing enter.

{text} contains the contents of the input or textarea (Or contenteditable). So you can do

``` translate {text} for me ```

And it translates the things you have in your editor.

``` Summarize the following {text} ```

Will of course, summarize all the text in the editor.

You can add your own OpenAI API key, or just use our server. It will be using GPT3.5-turbo and is ad supported. But very lightly.
